/**
This class creates a motion or ghost, in the sense of the animation term "ghosting", trail.
It maybe used for many types of effects, like, but not reduced to, motion trails, moving ribbons, flags, and others
 
Requires a parent scene node so it can follow it, and updates its mesh with the positions of this node.
Has several alignment options, suited for many situations, but just in the case a single scene node isn't enough
it can be specified a second node to have full control of how the trail behaves.
 
It has a single texture coordinate applied, and it doesn't support tangent space for now, though the normals for this node
may update if there is need for lighting, for instance.
 
It may animate on its own, or it can be specified to be animated on demand, for instance on a multiple rendering pass setup. (shadow maps)
 
It has a wind parameter designed to make the whole set of points move in the specified direction, if set. Though it is a bit too much sensitive
 
This node isn't affected by the rotations or scale operations, simply because it is an special effect, and depends on the parent node
to move. Not obstant, the position shifts the location of the effect. This shift is done in the parents space, not in global space, unless the
parent was the root scene node...
 
If there is no parent node, it doesn't render at all.
